## OBJECTIVES:

Apply DevOps and practice the ff.

#### Continuous Integration (CI)

is the software engineering practice of frequently integrating isolated changes to a larger code base and testing them immediately.

The goal of Continuous Integration is to verify the correctness of those changes and to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.
For this it is quite common to run automated tests after every integration.


#### Continuous Development (CD)

is the ability to build software that can be released to production at any time. The goal of Continuous Delivery is to ensure the code of a software is always in a deployable state, no matter if it includes new features or just bug fixes.


and use the ff. tools:

#### JENKINS

#### FASTLANE

#### and integrate it with GITHUB or BITBUCKET XD
